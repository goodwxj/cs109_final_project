    "# Part 1: Data Cleanup\n",
    "To begin with, we will first look at the data to see what features / columns we should keep. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here in our case, we will use the most recent 1.5 million record from the Chicago crime dataset instead of using the whole dataset (which contains 6 million records back to year 2001. This will covers the crime data back from year 2011. We choose not to use earlier data because the distribution of crimes can change over time due to various reasons, and the most recent 4 to 5 years will be more relevant to the current situation (if we view the problem as a classification problem instead of a time-series problem).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will clean up the data as below:\n",
    "1. Throw away extremely rare crime types and locations. We understand that this step may introduce some bias, and having this step may not significantly improve our classification accuracy. However, this step reduces the number of features we input for the classification algorithms, and also reduces the types of crime we need to classify our data into (when doing multiclassfication).\n",
    "2. Throw away rows with vague information (for example \"others\") or typo or NA.\n",
    "3. Convert categorical features such as crime type and police district to dummy (indicator) variables.\n",
    "4. Extract the time information (and convert categorical features such as weekdays to dummy variables).\n",
    "5. Merge the data with weather data.\n",
    "6. Add a feature \"distance to closest police station\".\n",
    "7. Include several features describing the income, housing condition, education level and population structure of the area where the crime takes place."

Of course, we can also treat each individual time point as a data point instead of binning all data points together (in that case, we can calculate an exact distance between two time points for KNN or other distance-based algorithms). The situation is actually similar for the location data: we can use the exact coordiates to calculate certain distance for classification, or we can simply use the police districts (now as indicator variable) which bin / cluster the coordiates together. In the current data cleanup step, I will save both the exact information and the \"binned\" information, but we will determine what information to use later depends on the exact strategies."

As a result, we include several columns of continuous variables describing income / education level / population structure based on the \"Community Area\". The data is also provided by the government of Chicago.\n",

We will still indlude the police district as a categorical feature (indicator variable), since the information provided by the police district feature does not overlap 100% with those features generated from community area (though correlation exists, since a police district covers several community areas). For example, two locations belong to two police districts may have similar income but different types of crime, depending on the man power or focus of the police district. Therefore, we will use police district information as a categorical feature (of course, we can also break this categorical feature into several small features, such as number of police per area / population, but those information will be hard to find)."
