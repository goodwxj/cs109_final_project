We have four notebooks. Notebook 0 is the summary notebook linked to other notebooks. Notebook 1 is data cleanup. Notebook 2 is the visualization notebook (exploratory data analyis). Notebook 3 is the modeling notebook (final analysis). In notebook 2, we used a python map package to map the crime to google map called Folium (see the notebook for details). We also submitted the html files for the crime maps (can be downloaded and viewed with internet conneciton).
